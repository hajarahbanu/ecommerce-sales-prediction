Sales Forecasting Challenge: Project Requirement Document




 Problem Statement:


We live in the world of e-commerce where transactions happen continuously across various platforms. In this project, your task is to predict future daily sales based on historical transaction data of an online UK retailer that sells unique all-occasion gifts.


This dataset captures real transactions between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011.


Your goal is to


Analyze sales patterns.


Forecast the next 7 days of total revenue.


Share insights, approach, and predictions.

Tasks to Complete


1. Data Preprocessing
Load and explore the data.


Handle missing values, if any (e.g., missing CustomerIDs).


Aggregate daily sales (Daily Revenue = sum of Quantity × UnitPrice per day).


Visualize sales trends.


2. Forecasting
       Build a simple sales forecasting model:


       You can use ARIMA / Prophet / XGBoost / any lightweight method.


        Predict total daily revenue for the next 7 days.


        Visualize actual vs forecasted sales.


3. Reporting
Provide a summary of:


Data understanding and assumptions.


Modeling approach.


Results and interpretations.


Include plots (like revenue trend, forecast plot).


Deliverables

GitHub repo containing:


notebooks/solution.ipynb or .py script.


README.md explaining approach and findings.


Any additional plots, metrics, or files.
